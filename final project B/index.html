    <p1>About
      <p>Balance was a two-week-long project I made with the help of my professor. Moon and my classmates. As the
        project
        for my final, I aimed to let players keep the balance between different colors. Sometimes, these blocks with
        different colors can also be interpreted as multiple tasks in our lives. When you reach out to another, you may
        fail in the current one. To keep the balance, players should focus on the position of our final goals and find a
        better way out.</p>
